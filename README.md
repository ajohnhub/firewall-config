Alright, now that you are connected to your VM you will have to enable IIS. Simply access the control panel then select uninstall a program. Off to the left select "Turn windows features on or off". A list will appear then you will enable Internet Information Services.

Excellent. Now that you have enabled IIS we need to install Web Platform Installer. I have provided a link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6
  That link will provide you with all of the material you need to download to get osTicket up and running. Simply click the link and install the Web Platform Installer

</p>
<p>
Once you have installed Web Installer Platform open it. From inside the application you are going to install MySQL 5.5 Afterwards install x86 version of PHP up until 7.3. There are some failed files such as C++ redistributable package as well as PHP 7.3.8 and PHP Manager for IIS those files can be found with the install link.

<p>
Next download osTicket. Then extract and copy the "upload" folder into c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Afterwards rename the folder to osTicket

<p>
</p>
<p>
Open IIS Manager and restart the server. Once inside IIS manager go to Sites->Default->osTicket on the right, click "Browse*.80" from there your default browser should open osTicket webserver.

<p>
</p>
<p>
Go back into IIS manager and enable some extensions. To do this you have to go to Sites->Default->osTicket
Then double click on PHP manager. Click on "Disable or enable an extension" Enable "php_intl.dll" & "php_opcache.dll" then refresh the osTicket webserver and obsereve the changes "Intl Extension" should now be enabled.

</p>
<p>
Go back into c:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php rename the file to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
Assign permissions to ost-config.php Disable inheritance->Removeall
New Permissions->Everyone->all

</p>
<p>
Afterwards continue setting up osTicket in the browser (click continue) then you will name the Helpdesk to your liking. Select a default email that will receive emails from customers who submit tickets.

Congratulations, hopefully it is installed with no errors!
